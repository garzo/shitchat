# Awful Chat
This app is a maguffin.
It doesn't actually matter.

None of this matters.

Does it?

If a developer makes a pull request, but doesn't comment her code
...did she really write it?

I wonder.

Anyway. This is just an app is practically a punching bag. It's for me to train on.
Fork this, do something with it, make it better if you want. 

Just commment your damn code.
